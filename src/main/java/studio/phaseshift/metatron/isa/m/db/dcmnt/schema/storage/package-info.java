/**
 * Storage schema for document databases.
 * <p>
 * This package contains classes that define how metatron encodes and stores its own data
 * in MongoDB/DocumentDB. This is the internal representation used by metatron for persistence.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Storage Schema Responsibilities</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Key-value encoding for mtron objects</li>
 *   <li>Index management for efficient queries</li>
 *   <li>Type serialization/deserialization</li>
 *   <li>Collection structure for metatron's internal data</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Contrast with Domain Schema</h2>
 * <p>
 * Storage schema is about <b>how metatron stores data</b>, while domain schema
 * (in {@link studio.phaseshift.metatron.isa.m.db.dcmnt.schema.domain}) is about
 * <b>how users' existing collections are structured</b>.
 * </p>
 *
 * @see studio.phaseshift.metatron.isa.m.db.dcmnt.schema.domain Domain schema package
 * @see studio.phaseshift.metatron.isa.m.db.tble.schema.storage SQL storage schema reference
